# EDA-on-Global-Terrorism-Dataset
In this project, we will be performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the GTD to gain insights into the patterns and trends of global terrorism. Our goal is to analyze the data and identify the factors that contribute to terrorism, such as the location, type of attack, target, and the group responsible.
